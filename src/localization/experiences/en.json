      "description": "Big organizations carry a lot of prestige. Most are hierarchical, slow in adapting to change and have a reputation for tolerating a lot of abuse. The larger and more prestigious, the less accountability for the people at the top. This combination of prestige, legacy, hierarchy and no accountability is the perfect environment for toxic leaders to prevail. Whether it’s the UN, EU, or government - once you’re in and things turn toxic, anonymously shared stories suggest that in these types of work environments very little is done to support targets of psychological violence and harassment.",
