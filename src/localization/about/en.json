    "description": "There is a lot of fear and shame surrounding experiences of toxicity at a workplace. Because it is still more shameful and stigmatized to be the person experiencing abuse than the one inflicting harm on others, only few people have enough privilege to speak out and take the risk of losing reputation and future career prospects. This is why, according to the International Labor Organizationâ€™s 2022 Global Survey, out of 750 million people experiencing psychological violence and harassment at work, half never tell anyone about it, suffering in silence.",
