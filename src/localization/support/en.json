You have the power to break free from its grip, prioritize your health, and take control of your future. It's never too late to make a change and to ensure that you're not sacrificing your wellbeing for the sake of a toxic workplace.

Many people exclude this option completely, or only start considering it when it is already too late to gather the right amount and type of evidence.\n\nEven without following the legal route, having a paper trail will be very helpful in bringing your situation to the attention of HR. Without evidence, you are putting yourself in a very difficult position. Your complaint might bring no effect or could potentially cause more damage than help.\n\nPeople often wait until it’s too late before they collect evidence because they don’t recognize the signs of toxic leadership. \n\nTo learn about toxic leadership and how to recognize it visit our Get Informed page. For examples of how toxic leadership manifests in practice and how it impacts individuals, please visit Real Stories of toxic leadership.\n\nOur research also shows that often the positive outcome of legal action doesn’t bring closure because the compensation received does not equal acknowledgement of wrong-doing by the person who caused harm.\n\nBecause of the expenses and the level of stress involved in taking the legal route, make sure you consult an employment lawyer to learn what the chances for a positive outcome are, given the type of evidence you have collected. Let the legal expert tell you exactly what is possible in your country/region, as not every system allows for claiming damages caused by harmful leadership practices.\n\nAs a society, we are still at the very beginning of growing awareness and understanding of the importance of mental health at work. This means that neither the legal system nor most workplaces offer adequate preventive and compensation measures.",

A great place to start is using apps such as <Link target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.betterhelp.com\">BetterHelp</Link>,  <Link target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.headspace.com\">Headspace</Link> or visiting <Link  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.therapyroute.com\">Therapy Route</Link>  to find a therapist near you.\n\nWe also recommend you learn more about power dynamics and narcissism to understand why and how unhealthy relationships develop and how they can be navigated. A great source of information on this topic is a blog by <Link target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://substack.com/@nathaliemartinekphd\"}>Dr. Nathalie Martinek</Link>\n\nIf your work provides counseling and you trust their services, make the most of this opportunity as therapy and coaching can be pricey. It’s important that you trust your therapist or coach. Otherwise, you may feel even more vulnerable after sharing sensitive information about yourself and your situation.\n\nIf despite available support you feel none of it can help in your situation, reach out to crisis helplines, who are there for you when the going gets very tough. And remember, toxic leadership is a systemic not individual problem. It may feel like you are the only one affected, but according to the International Labour Organization’s Global Survey (2022), there are 750 million people around the world who experience violence and harassment at work - that’s one in five working people.
