## VENT about the toxic boss Interviews

Through anonymous interviews, VENT collects stories of people's experiences of incivility and exploitation in a work context.

Our goals are:

- To give people a safe space to talk about what they went through.
- To transform traumatic experiences into valuable contributions co-creating awareness and informing development of solutions.
- To research experiences and impact of toxic leadership.
-  To create awareness and reduce normalization of violence and harassment at work.

Apart from written stories, VENT also creates cartoons. The stories are edited to ensure anonymity and only parts which showcase patterns of abuse are shared. 
The cartoon characters look and sound nothing like the speaker. Transcribed interviews are paraphrased and identifiable details edited out to ensure anonymity. Any similarity to specific persons, companies and events is accidental. 

After the content is produced and information about the patterns extracted, the original recording is permanently deleted within two weeks from the interview date. The interviewee receives information about each phase of the process.

All content is recorded and published with contributors’ consent.
