# About the project

There is a lot of fear and shame surrounding experiences of toxicity at a workplace. Because it is still more shameful and stigmatized to be the person experiencing abuse than the one inflicting harm on others, only few people have enough privilege to speak out and take the risk of losing reputation and future career prospects. This is why, according to the International Labor Organization’s 2022 Global Survey, out of 750 million people experiencing psychological violence and harassment at work, half never tell anyone about it, suffering in silence.

## What we do

The first interviews were part of a problem validation exercise and it became quickly apparent that the interviews themselves hold great value. Two main reasons being:

1. They give people a safe space to vent and be heard by a compassionate listener who can relate due to their own experiences of toxicity at a workplace - reducing fear, shame and isolation.

2. Storytelling serves a purpose greater than just venting - it builds solidarity and helps people heal, while reducing the normalization and acceptance of toxic leadership and exploitation.

The stories presented on this website are a compilation of lived experiences of over 100 people from around the world. All genders, ages, ethnicities, seniority levels and industries.The data on experiences of toxic leadership is being collected on an ongoing basis, making this hub an expanding resource for individuals, researchers and companies interested in preventing and dealing with damage caused by the acceptance and normalization of dysfunctional management practices in a workplace.

Each story contains information from multiple sources and the quotations are paraphrased in order to protect the identity of the interviewees. Presenting the content in this way is possible thanks to recurring patterns within the  abuse, impact and exit stories.
