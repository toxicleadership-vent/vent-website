## Developing solutions and tools

Powered by contributions of our “VENT about the toxic boss Interviews” community, VENT brings together multidisciplinary experts to collaborate on developing technology-driven as well as low-tech solutions and tools, which help reduce the impact and normalization of toxic leadership.

### High tech - deep insight

We are open for collaborations with university professors and independent researchers focused on researching a wide spectrum of topics such as, and not limited to: organizational psychology, corporate psychopathy, toxic leadership, social justice, zemiology, corporate social responsibility, neuropsychology, ethics and values ,gender and diversity studies, behavioral studies, and more.

### Low tech - high impact

If you are looking for a tailor-made solution and prefer it to involve less technology and more human touch, we are open for collaborations focusing on developing workshops and programs designed to address toxic leadership and its aftermath within teams, organizations and communities.
