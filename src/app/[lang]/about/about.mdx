### Our Mission

VENT is a collaborative hub dedicated to mitigating the impact of toxic leadership on individuals, communities, businesses, and the environment.

### Our Approach

Through anonymous interviews, we gather stories of workplace incivility and exploitation, ensuring anonymity and highlighting systemic patterns of abuse across industries.

### Our Goals

- Provide a safe space for individuals to share their experiences.   
- Transform trauma into awareness and actionable solutions.  
- Research the effects of toxic leadership.  
- Combat the normalization of workplace violence and harassment.  

### Storytelling and Education

Alongside written narratives, we produce cartoons and educational campaigns to convey these experiences.

### Research  

We engage with multidisciplinary experts and collaborate with researchers in organizational psychology as well as corporate social responsibility, and more.
