“I come to work to contribute, to innovate, to share and collaborate, to feel synergy, to guide, influence, mentor and learn. That’s what I go to work for. To create something better and to become the best version of myself. I compete with myself and when toxicity plays a role it is so defeating and it’s a massive obstacle to all the things I just described.

So why is it acceptable?
Why does the CEO not want to deal with all the HR stuff and treats it like lowest priority?

Their focus is the bottom line and that’s all. Don’t they think that diverse environments where people are happy positively impact the bottom line? Squeezing people and telling them they must be high performers is not a high-performance environment, it’s a shitty environment! And then their businesses are tanking, and they never correlate it!  
What would you like to know?
What story should I share?
I don’t even know where to start, I have millions of them.

I’ll tell you about the most recent one:
I was working for a startup which had an amazing culture! I was employed as a recruiter and their values, and the culture made my job very easy. I was able to sell this workplace so well, even get people to agree to a lower pay because I was so convinced this place was everything you ever wanted. We always started by having a culture fit interview to make sure our talent genuinely valued diversity. Only once this stage was successfully passed, we moved on to the next phase of recruitment.

I had a wonderful manager, who taught me how to implement all the tools you would need to ensure diverse hires. This was the best job I ever had. The leaders believed in the culture, they wanted to have an amazing, diverse, healthy, and happy team. The founder was very vocal about making people the priority.

As we were growing fast due to VC funding, we got a new HR Director. When they came, I met with them and told them about the culture here being precious. They responded by saying: “in order to grow we will have to give up some of that culture”. I was shocked!
There is a difference between saying “we have to evolve culture” and “we have to give up culture”. For me, the question was “how can we scale this amazing culture? Can this scale with 10 000 people?”. And I concluded that yes, it is possible, but it needs to be done across the organization. So, when they said that to grow, we need to ditch some of that culture, I was perplexed. What could they be talking about exactly? What am I missing? I am the first point of contact attracting talent, I need to know this. I need to be authentic and genuine when speaking with prospects.

They decided to add two more directors. The first one was their close friend with whom they worked at a previous company. The other one represented a client of ours and was, in my opinion, given this job as a favor. All three of them came from the same city and knew each other prior to joining this team. That’s nepotism.

I advised the founders that going down the nepotism path will impact the organization negatively and certainly do nothing for diversity, but my concerns were totally ignored.

So, what started happening was the following: the first person to leave the company was responsible for DEI. This person was extremely passionate about the role and did an amazing job until one of the directors (a white lady) told them their role was not needed now. Can you imagine? What kind of statement is that? DEI is continuous work, and we have a very long way ahead of us.

Then they removed the possibility to give anonymous internal feedback because a lot of it was directed at them. However, they argumented this decision with “it opens the door to racism”. Immediately voices were raised that the HR team was not being monitored. What we heard back from the C-suite was that HR is the auditor and doesn’t need auditing.

They fired most of the operational staff, which meant that now the HR and recruitment team was built mostly of senior managers and directors and then a couple junior to mid-level recruiters. The pay was extremely unevenly distributed. These 3 directors gave themselves salaries 2-3 times bigger than the rest of us.

The performance reviews stopped focusing on impact and collaboration and facilitated a rat race and competition. Derogatory language for BIPOC people was used during management meetings, and more and more people were leaving or being fired.

I was extremely uncomfortable and started to feel depressed. People’s mental health was getting seriously affected as this amazing culture we fell in love with was being completely dismantled.

We were constantly hiring new people for other departments, many of them BIPOC. I wanted to warn them that the directors here were racists, but I didn’t. I didn’t know how.

Despite exceeding my hiring targets, I was constantly receiving feedback about being an underperformer, while my manager was regularly late to meetings, including interviews! There were even bad reviews online from people who had interviews scheduled with them and they simply didn’t show up.

The racism and humiliation were consistent. All the work we did to ensure diversity recruitment was reversed. Then they started laying people off and outsourcing to referrals who were a friend of a friend.

When my performance was being so unfairly assessed, while the managers covered each other's back, I started collecting evidence. I went to the doctor, told them about my impending burnout and depression, and I got a sick note. Then I submitted a formal complaint to the legal team about racism within the department, and I had the backing of witnesses to all incidents I mentioned. I also shared a list of my observations with the C-suite, and I said that I couldn’t work with such people, and we needed to find a solution.
The only solution they offered was to lay me off. The racism investigation went nowhere. I got a lawyer and managed to get a higher severance but now I feel like I sold out.

So, my story ends with me having lost my job because I spoke out about incidents of racism. And I had witnesses and still nothing was done about it! These people still have their highly overpaid jobs and they do absolutely nothing to develop the culture of that organization. They reverse it!

I don’t know yet what I will do next, but I am not playing the game.”
