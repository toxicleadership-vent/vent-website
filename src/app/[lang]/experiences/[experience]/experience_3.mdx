# HR at a governmental organization

“If anyone told me 15 years ago where I would be now, I would not have believed them. I do believe that human beings are essentially good, but we get into toxic environments and there is so much damage, which nobody sees. I am now at a point where I can talk about it and not be upset. It’s like a scar that has been hit so many times that it’s become hardened, and I wish it on nobody. That’s why when I read your invitation to talk about these experiences, I was very happy to share them with you and the world. I now have 2 court cases and I continue to fight because I want to contribute to a world where people don't have to go through this.

At the time when I was struggling the most, the organization I worked for was transitioning to new structures, and all the HR people were busy with everything else but supporting employees. I was told by a company psychologist that the HR department is so busy I will only get a response if I am in management.

It was a climactic point for me. I needed my employer to share vital information on how I can proceed, and I needed them to fill out important paperwork but they were nowhere to be found. It took 3 months for me to get an answer and because of that I made some bad choices. I went on leave without pay rather than go on long-term disability, which I would have qualified for.

I started seeing a psychologist but after going on unpaid leave, I couldn’t continue with that, so I went to a mental health institution to help with vocational rehabilitation but that didn’t include the treatment of my PTSD.

I had my work failing me but also my doctor, who was about to retire and after 4 months of treating my burnout said: “You just need to go back to work. People expect you to get better!”.

Because in general these professionals don’t communicate with each other, they work in silos. Each of them has a bit of the puzzle but they don’t ask enough questions. There were so many errors and gaps. There were some honest mistakes made but also efforts to cover them up. I am only now coming to the point where I have clarity and can see how messy it was.

I was not clear minded then, I struggled to understand what I should do, I was asking for help and some guidance, and nobody gave me the right kind of information. I missed my insurance deadline by a year and half as none of the professionals I asked for help were able to correlate my needs with the solutions in place. Not my doctor, my psychologist, my employer - nobody. I was completely shocked how unprepared they all were. Nobody knew to ask me the right questions to understand if I am getting the help I need, and I didn’t realize that I wasn’t. All this was happening on top of my complaints about abuse being ignored.

Here’s the thing about my first toxic boss, she made her boss look good. She did ⅔ of his job at the cost of our team. We had those weekly meetings during which nearly all 20 of us were crying. We were not permanent, we were on contracts, so you know, you feel like you have nothing and when you feel scared, your executive functions go out the window. You look to each other for support, and everybody is scared and feel like they are on a boat and the boat is sinking.

I look back now and see how normalized it was. People around me would say that either I was exaggerating or shrugging me off by asking “ok, so why don’t you just change jobs?”. My friends were there, my whole life was there, my support system was there, the money was very good, and it was just easier to stay.

I was in this culture for years and kept feeling that I could make it better if only I managed to move to the HR department. After a while I did get the position I wanted and that's when things got even worse.

There was a bully on our team. Just like my previous boss, he made his boss look good by doing most of the job for him while bullying half of our team. He was the only man. Short-tempered, no respect for women. None of us wanted to stay alone in the office with him. We always checked with each other when the last one was leaving. I was dealing with my own bullying from him, and I watched him take down other women.

I saw them speak up, and I spoke up and nothing happened! There was no system in place to voice our grievance. And that was in 2018 at a governmental institution, so imagine if that was happening then, how many years has this been going on for? I am probably one of hundreds who tried to report abuse and was ignored. But they keep you separate and make you think you are the only one.

I went three levels up to seek help and no one was doing anything. So I started thinking I must be doing something wrong. Am I the only one who is seeing this? What can I do? Where can I go?

By that time, I had cognitive issues, I was losing my memory, I was irritable and my family was noticing me change. I didn’t have my usual passion for life as all these things were sucking the soul out of me.
The bully was caught red-handed by complete coincidence as he became physically violent and only then the bosses felt inclined to act. Now that it was a legal issue. What type of consequences did he face? They gave him a month off to “decompress” and implemented emergency team sessions with a psychologist to help him stay on the team with us despite our multiple complaints about his behavior. In the end, they moved him to another department where nobody knew his history. Was there an investigation into claims of psychological violence and bullying? No. He is happily building his career, gearing up for promotion, most likely still bullying people.  
When he was leaving, the boss who benefitted from the bully’s way of working praised him for all his hard work in front of all of those who not only suffered but also complained to them about the abuse. I joined the Union after that but in the end I never felt safe to speak up again.  
I cannot believe I dedicated 25 years of my career to a place which was so ready to show me that they didn’t care about my mental health.
