**Toxic patterna**: neglecting employee needs, lack of support, communication silos

“If anyone told me 15 years ago where I would be now, I would not have believed them. I do believe that human beings are essentially good, but we get into toxic environments and there is so much damage, which nobody sees. I am now at a point where I can talk about it and not be upset. It’s like a scar that has been hit so many times that it’s become hardened, and I wish it on nobody. That’s why when I read your invitation to talk about these experiences, I was very happy to share them with you and the world. I now have 2 court cases and I continue to fight because I want to contribute to a world where people don't have to go through this.

At the time when I was struggling the most, the organization I worked for was transitioning to new structures, and all the HR people were busy with everything else but supporting employees. I was told by a company psychologist that the HR department is so busy I will only get a response if I am in management.

It was a climactic point for me. I needed my employer to share vital information on how I can proceed, and I needed them to fill out important paperwork but they were nowhere to be found. It took 3 months for me to get an answer and because of that I made some bad choices.

I had my work failing me but also my doctor, who was about to retire, and after 4 months of treating my burnout said to me: “You just need to go back to work. People expect you to get better!”.

Because in general professionals such as doctors, lawyers, psychologists don’t communicate with each other, they work in silos - each of them has a bit of the puzzle but they don’t ask enough questions. There were so many errors and gaps. There were some honest mistakes made but also efforts to cover them up. I am only now coming to the point where I have clarity and can see how messy it was.

I was not clear minded then, I struggled to understand what I should do, I was asking for help and some guidance, and nobody gave me the right kind of information. I missed my insurance deadline by a year and half as none of the professionals I asked for help were able to correlate my needs with the solutions in place. Not my doctor, my psychologist, my employer - nobody. I was completely shocked how unprepared they all were. Nobody knew to ask me the right questions to understand if I am getting the help I need, and I didn’t realize that I wasn’t. All this was happening on top of my complaints about abuse being ignored.

I developed PTSD and needed to stop working. Because of missing the insurance deadline I am now fighting in court to get that money back and to get disability benefits which I qualify for, and should be getting for years now. If it wasn’t for my employer’s utter neglect, I would not be where I am today. If any of the professionals were trauma informed and recognized the type of abuse I was experiencing - I would not be where I am today.

But I am not throwing myself a pity party, I am fighting, so that this doesn’t happen to anyone else in the future“
