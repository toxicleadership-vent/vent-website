I was a junior assistant and she was the leader of the legal department, middle leadership, I would say. At first, we started off really well, as friends with a similar background. She took care of me, and invited me to her house to meet her friends.

One of my duties at the company was to contact clients with certain legal questions that were not directly related to what she was doing. And for some reason she took it as some personal threat, that I was trying to undermine her, that I’m trying to steal her position, whatever.

Instead of talking to me, she went to her boss, who was on my side, which she didn’t know. She complained to him, lying about what I did, trying to portray me as an evil person, so that they would fire me. But he knew me perfectly and said that was BS, and that I would never have done that. Then he asked me “What did you do?” and I told him and he asked me “Is this your direct responsibility?” and I said “Yes, it’s written in my contract that I’m supposed to do this.” But this woman kept micromanaging everyone, she tried to gossip a lot in the company, spread fake and false information.

She was starting to get very nervous and eventually she was almost fired because of that. One morning she texted me on my private phone number and called me at six in the morning and started threatening me that if I was not stopping what I was doing she was going to use some power, whatever, to get me out of the company. She crossed all the lines, social and personal. Of course, I was distressed and super scared. I was scared of whatever she could do, she seemed to be completely uncontrollable. I was distressed for a long time, but the HR department didn’t really care about employee wellbeing. They said “As you’re a grownup - deal with it!”.

Employees weren’t given any opportunity to be human beings, they were just basically meat, calculators, tools to do all the jobs. No one ever cared for emotional or health aspects.
