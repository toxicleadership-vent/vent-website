# How to spot a toxic leader?

When leadership takes a toxic turn, it can have far-reaching, damaging consequences for individuals, companies, communities, the environment, and the economy. Here are some common dysfunctional behaviors, which can help you identify whether you are dealing with a toxic leader:

## 1. Patronizing Behavior

A significant red flag of a toxic leader is patronizing behavior. Regardless of your experience, age, or background, there is no justification for being spoken down to. If you find yourself on the receiving end of condescending remarks or demeaning attitudes, it's a clear sign that this leader is attempting to make you feel small. This behavior often stems from their own insecurities.

## 2. Excessive Charm and Manipulation

Toxic leaders can be incredibly charming and charismatic, often appearing as the life of the party. However, their charm is often a facade that conceals manipulative intentions. You may find yourself agreeing to take on extra work, responsibilities, and exerting additional effort without receiving due recognition or appreciation. If you constantly feel like you're doing them a favor, while they bask in the benefits of your hard work, it's a red flag that you're being manipulated.

## 3. Dishonesty and Broken Promises

Toxic leaders frequently resort to dishonesty. They might make promises of promotions, pay raises, time off, or other incentives, but these commitments often remain unfulfilled. It's not uncommon for them to appear friendly and engaging while secretly harboring contempt. If your intuition tells you that their words and actions don't align, dishonesty is a major red flag that should not be ignored.

## 4. Creating a Hostile Environment

Toxic leaders may subtly create an uncomfortable environment through occasional insensitive comments. These comments can target your age, nationality, or even take on a sexist tone. While on the surface, everything may seem fine, these occasional glimpses of ignorance and disrespect reveal their true feelings. Feeling undervalued or disrespected due to such prejudice is a clear indicator of a toxic leader.

## 5. Neglect of Their Own Health

A leader who consistently neglects their own well-being is a massive red flag. Whether they are overworked, stressed, or engage in self-destructive habits like excessive drinking, smoking, over-exercising and barely eating or sedentary lifestyle or poor eating habits, it indicates a lack of regard for their own health. Such leaders are unlikely to prioritize the well-being of their team members.

## 6. Humiliation and Belittlement

Toxic leaders often exhibit a Jekyll and Hyde personality. Initially, they may appear cool, humorous, and generous, but then they abruptly shift to a darker side. They may use personal information to belittle or make dismissive comments about your performance or appearance in front of others. This behavior can create a hostile dynamic within the team and is a glaring red flag of toxic leadership.

Identifying a toxic leader is crucial for protecting yourself and your team from the damaging consequences of their behavior. If you encounter patronizing attitudes, manipulation through excessive charm, dishonesty, the creation of a hostile environment, disregard for their own health, or humiliation and belittlement, it's essential to take action. Toxic leadership not only harms individuals but can have wide-reaching negative effects on organizations, communities, and society at large. Recognizing the red flags is the first step toward addressing this issue and fostering healthier, more positive leadership.
