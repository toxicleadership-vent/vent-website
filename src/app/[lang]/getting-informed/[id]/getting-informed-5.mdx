# Why should we talk about it?

Talking about toxic leadership is the first step in addressing this pandemic-scale problem. The silence around the abuse of power only benefits the self-serving leaders, who benefit from the lack of accountability and no way to measure this aspect of their performance.

By sharing our experiences of harassment and violence at work, we can expose the extent of this problem and pave the way for change. It is essential to create work environments where employees thrive without fear, humiliation and exploitation. Workplaces, where managers and leaders are given the right kind of tools to perform up to high standards, which do not exclude the impact their leadership styles have on the wellbeing and performance of employees.

This begins with awareness, which comes from sharing stories and exposing the suffering, which lies below the surface.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have become more conscious of the importance of mental health at work. This health crisis has shed the light on various aspects of our everyday lives that hinder overall wellness. As we transition from a reactive state to a proactive one, our aim is to prevent harm rather than gather the pieces left once the damage is done.

- "I got a new job and quit."
- "I quit without a new job."
- "I asked for feedback and got fired on the spot."
- "I got so burned out that I couldn't say my name and was hospitalized. They fired me when I came back."

These quotes represent a variety of ways in which a person may end up leaving a toxic workplace. Not everyone can afford to look for another job or to leave without having found one. Those who need the most support are people, who feel they are out of options.

Having no way out is a crushing feeling in itself. What about when you feel like you are the only person in the world who ended up in this position?

The more we talk about toxic leadership, the less people will feel trapped and alone. The less people feel trapped and alone, the more hope, courage and strength they will have to create a better future for themselves.

## We have to talk to learn from each other

There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of experiencing incivility at work. How a person deals with this challenge depends on many factors such as their financial security, family situation, level of work experience, and other career prospects. A lot depends on the level of privilege, types of limitations and what kind of support is available.

By sharing experiences and solutions we can learn from each other and support one another in improving our individual and collective wellbeing.

One of the solutions, which would benefit a lot from being talked about, is taking legal action against toxic leadership. As it is a complex, expensive and stressful process, many people exclude this option completely, or only start considering it when it is already too late to gather the right amount and type of evidence.

Some of the most common experiences and attitudes towards taking legal action can be illustrated by the following quotes from our interviews:

- "I spoke to a lawyer but they discouraged me, saying I would have to have a recording of them abusing me basically."
- "I didn't know where to turn and how to look for the information."
- "Nobody takes legal action. Nobody wants to leave a bad smell after they leave. You never know where and when you meet this person again and how much more damage they can cause in your life."
- "We can't take legal action – they are too well connected and have immunity."

It is always advisable to collect evidence early and keep any written communication. Even without following the legal route, having a paper trail will be very helpful in bringing your situation to the attention of HR. Without evidence, you are putting yourself in a very difficult position. Your complaint might bring no effect or could potentially cause more damage than help.

Why do people wait until it’s too late before they collect evidence? Because they don’t recognize the signs of toxic leadership. And why do they not recognize these signs? Because nobody in their life ever talks about it. When abuse is normalized, it goes under the radar for as long as the target can physically and mentally handle it.

It is crucial to de-normalize toxic behaviors and management tactics so that more people can recognize the signs early enough to make informed decisions. Focusing on leaders and training them to be better in their roles is a vital step, but it's not enough. Employees must also be empowered to recognize, speak up, and reject harmful leadership practices without fearing for their reputation, wellbeing, or future. More important than that, we should talk about toxic leadership to build solidarity and reduce the number of people who feel alone with this problem. A problem, which is systemic - not individual!
