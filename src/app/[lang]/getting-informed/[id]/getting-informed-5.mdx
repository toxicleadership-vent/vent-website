# Why should we talk about it?

Talking about toxic leadership is the first step in addressing this pandemic-scale problem. The silence around the abuse of power only benefits the self-serving leaders, who benefit from the lack of accountability and no way to measure this aspect of their performance.

By sharing our experiences of harassment and violence at work, we can expose the extent of this problem and pave the way for change. It is essential to create work environments where employees thrive without fear, humiliation and exploitation. Workplaces, where managers and leaders are given the right kind of tools to perform up to high standards, which do not exclude the impact their leadership styles have on the wellbeing and performance of employees.

This begins with awareness, which comes from sharing stories and exposing the suffering, which lies below the surface.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have become more conscious of the importance of mental health at work. This health crisis has shed the light on various aspects of our everyday lives that hinder overall wellness. As we transition from a reactive state to a proactive one, our aim is to prevent harm rather than gather the pieces left once the damage is done.

- "I got a new job and quit."
- "I quit without a new job."
- "I asked for feedback and got fired on the spot."
- "I got so burned out that I couldn't say my name and was hospitalized. They fired me when I came back."

These quotes represent a variety of ways in which a person may end up leaving a toxic workplace. Not everyone can afford to look for another job or to leave without having found one. Those who need the most support are people, who feel they are out of options.

Having no way out is a crushing feeling in itself. What about when you feel like you are the only person in the world who ended up in this position?

Talking about toxic leadership builds solidarity and reduces the number of people who feel alone with this problem. A problem, which is systemic - not individual!
