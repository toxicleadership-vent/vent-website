![Hero Image for article](/images/hero.png)

The word **"toxic"** has gained in popularity and is being grossly overused in contexts and situations as well as describing behaviors it doesn’t apply to. Where did the term "toxic leadership" come from and what does it actually stand for?

 In 1996, Marcia Lynn Whicker published a book titled "Toxic Leadership: when organizations go bad", and this was the first time the term was used and described  dysfunctional leadership styles.Dysfunctional behavior is defined as “any behavior that brings harm, or is intended to bring harm, to an organization, its employees, or stakeholders.” (Giacalone & Greenberg, 1997) Dysfunctional, toxic leaders are those individuals who inflict serious and enduring harm on the individuals, groups, organizations, communities and even the nations that they lead. (Lipman-Blumen, 2005) 

One of the best definitions of destructive (dysfunctional or toxic) leadership goes as follows: “the SYSTEMIC and REPEATED behavior by a leader, supervisor or manager that violates the legitimate interest of the organization by undermining and/or sabotaging the organization's goals, tasks, resources, and effectiveness and/or the motivation, well-being or job satisfaction of subordinates”(Einarsenet al., 2007)

 U.S. Army definition of Toxic Leadership:
"Toxic leadership is a combination of self-centered attitudes, motivations, and behaviors that have adverse effects on subordinates, the organization, and mission performance. Toxic leaders consistently use dysfunctional behaviors to deceive, intimidate, coerce, or unfairly punish others to get what they want for themselves."
