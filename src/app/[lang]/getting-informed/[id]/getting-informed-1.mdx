# What is toxic leadership?

In recent years, the term **toxic** has gained tremendous popularity, and it's often used to describe a wide range of behaviors and situations, to which it doesn’t apply. This increased usage made it more challenging for individuals to recognize when they are truly facing toxic leadership.

Let’s dive into the origins and definitions of toxic leadership to help you understand what it means:

## Origins of the Term

The term **"toxic leadership"** can be traced back to 1996 when Marcia Lynn Whicker published a groundbreaking book titled **"Toxic Leadership: When Organizations Go Bad."** It was within these pages that the concept was first introduced to describe dysfunctional leadership styles.

## Defining Dysfunction

Dysfunction in the leadership context is defined as **"any behavior that brings harm, or is intended to bring harm, to an organization, its employees, or stakeholders"** (Giacalone & Greenberg, 1997).

## Understanding Toxic Leadership

Toxic leaders are not just ineffective managers; they inflict serious and enduring harm on the individuals, groups, organizations, communities, and even the nations they lead (Lipman-Blumen, 2005). Toxic leadership encompasses a pattern of harmful behavior that affects every aspect of leadership.

## Defining Destructive Leadership

One of the most comprehensive definitions of destructive, dysfunctional, or toxic leadership is as follows: **"the systemic and repeated behavior by a leader, supervisor, or manager that violates the legitimate interest of the organization by undermining and/or sabotaging the organization's goals, tasks, resources, and effectiveness and/or the motivation, well-being, or job satisfaction of subordinates"** (Einarsen et al., 2007).

## U.S. Army's Take on Toxic Leadership

The U.S. Army provides an insightful definition of toxic leadership: **"Toxic leadership is a combination of self-centered attitudes, motivations, and behaviors that have adverse effects on subordinates, the organization, and mission performance. Toxic leaders consistently use dysfunctional behaviors to deceive, intimidate, coerce, or unfairly punish others to get what they want for themselves."**

## What are the basic things to remember about toxic leadership?

1. A Pattern of Harm:
   Toxic leadership is not about a single instance of poor decision-making or mismanagement. It's about a consistent pattern of behavior that harms the organization and its people.

1. Self-Centeredness:
   Toxic leaders are primarily concerned with their own interests, often at the expense of others. They prioritize personal gain over the well-being of the organization and its members.

1. Deceptive Behavior:
   Toxic leaders resort to deceit and manipulation to achieve their goals. They might provide false promises, misrepresent facts, or conceal their true intentions.

1. Intimidation and Coercion:
   The use of fear and intimidation is a hallmark of toxic leadership. Subordinates may be coerced into compliance, making it challenging for them to speak up or voice concerns.

1. Unfair Punishment: Toxic leaders use punishment as a tool for control. Subordinates who challenge their authority often face unwarranted consequences.

1. Erosion of Trust: Toxic leaders erode trust within the organization. Employees become wary, and morale drops as trust diminishes.

1. Impact on Mission: Toxic leadership has tangible adverse effects on the organization's mission and performance. It can hinder progress, damage relationships, and undermine goals.

1. Individual and Organizational Harm: Toxic leaders inflict harm not only on individuals but also on the organization as a whole. The negative consequences can extend to employees' well-being, job satisfaction, and overall success.

1. Systemic and Repeated: Toxic leadership is not a one-time occurrence. It is systemic and repeated, indicating a consistent and persistent pattern of destructive behavior.

Toxic leadership is a complex and deeply damaging phenomenon that goes beyond incompetence or bad management. It encompasses a consistent pattern of behavior that harms individuals, organizations, and their missions. By understanding its origins and definitions, we can better equip ourselves to identify and address it.
