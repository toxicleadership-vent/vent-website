# What impact does it have?

The longer you work in a toxic environment, the more time and money it will cost you to recover from psychological violence. The person(s), who caused the harm, either directly or by turning a blind eye, will not share in these expenses, even though you helped them build their careers and fortune.

## 1. The Hidden Costs of Toxic Leadership

Working in a toxic environment inevitably takes a toll on your wellbeing. The individuals responsible for this harm, be it through their direct actions or turning a blind eye, do not share in these expenses. As you struggle to repair the damage inflicted on your mind, body, and soul, they continue to advance in their careers, leaving you and others like you behind.

## 2. The Struggle to Rebuild

The psychological violence experienced in toxic workplaces can be overwhelming. The journey to recovery can be long, and sometimes the injuries are so severe that they make it impossible to achieve the quality of life you once dreamed of. Without your health, it becomes highly unlikely that you can become the best version of yourself.

## 3. The Impact

To offer a glimpse into the consequences of toxic leadership o individuals, here are a couple of quotes from people who experienced it:

### Impact on Mental Health:

"I felt like I was losing my mind. The constant stress and manipulation left me in a constant state of anxiety. I was unable to assess the quality of my work, to control my anger, my memory was affected and I couldn’t solve the most basic problems."

### Impact on Physical Health:

"The stress at work led to sleepless nights, digestive issues, and even high blood pressure. My body was screaming for help. Until one day I couldn’t talk any more and was hospitalized for exhaustion. Until today I am dealing with the aftermath of having damaged my body to such an extent."

### Impact on Social and Family Life:

"I became so distant from my family and friends. I didn't have the energy to socialize anymore or to connect with my partner. In the end, I felt like all I had left was work. Years later I massively regret missing out on important events and just the day to day, as I was so mentally and emotionally absent, which permanently reshaped the relationship I have with my now adult children”.

Toxic leadership can be a destructive force, but it doesn't have to define your life. You have the power to break free from its grip, prioritize your health, and take control of your future. Remember, it's never too late to make a change and to ensure that you're not sacrificing your wellbeing for the sake of a toxic workplace. Your health and happiness should always be your foremost concern, and your voice matters in shaping your destiny.
